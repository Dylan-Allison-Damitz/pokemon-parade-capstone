# Capstone Proposal

## Name of Student: 

Dylan Allison-Damitz

## Name of Project: 

Pokémon Parade!

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

This project will be a robust and dynamic social media application for fans of Pokémon. Users will be able to create Pokémon-themed profiles and collect new Pokémon (in the form of badges). Users will also be able to collect and share Poké balls with other users. Users will be able to post status updates, share photos and comment on other users' profiles. Users can train collected Pokémon at their local gym and test their skills against other user Pokémon in the arena, or tackle the RPG mode. 

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

I'd like to, at the very least, allow a user the ability to pick their favorite Pokémon and build a custom user profile based on that Pokémon. I'd like for users to be able to add pictures and create status updates.

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

-React.js
-NoSQL
-Firebase

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

If time allows, I'd like to start working on the built-in "training" functions for the user's Pokémon, which allows them to to evolve. If I still have time at that point, working on PvP functionality at the arena.

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

PokéAPI

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
